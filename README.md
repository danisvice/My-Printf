# Welcome to My Printf
***

## Task

+ create variadic function
+ challenge is to use syscalls in C to implement printf()
+ implement switch/case statements 
+ code refactorization to increase efficiency of program

## Description

+ visualizing the flow of how it could work 
+ asking questions in the zoom calls
+ format specifier research on printf(), write(), strlen(), sizeof(), uintptr_t, strlen().
- First begin implementing a convert() function in order to convert decimals into the 
    correct input data type.
- Second begine the int my_printf() function that will utilize a conditional statement,
    to iterate & execute each variable conversion.
- Third refactor the entire code for higher efficiency and clarity.

## Installation

+ Project installed via terminal
+ Utilizing gcc to compile the program 

## Usage

+ The project is a correct implementation of the printf() function in C. 
+ Unit Test Developed
+ works according to the custom variable conversion that were asked by the client. 

compile && run:
```
gcc my_printf.c -o ./my_printf
```
